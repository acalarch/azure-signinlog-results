50050|||||The request is malformed: invalid format for '{name}' value.|||||Contact the application owner.
50052|||||The password entered exceeds the maximum length. Please reach out to your admin to reset the password.|||||The user is unable to login because their password exceeds the permitted maximum length. They should contact their admin to reset the password. If SSPR is enabled for their tenant, they can reset their password by following the "Forgot your password" link.
50053|||||The account is locked, you've tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect user ID or password.|||||This error can be returned for two reasons - the sign in could have come from a malicious IP address, or the account was locked due to repeated sign-in attempts. Only one error code is used to prevent an attacker from distinguishing between the states. In your Azure AD tenant, you can distinguish between these states by looking at the specific sign-in log entry for this request. For accounts locked for too many attempts, see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-unblock-user
50054|||||Looks like you entered your old password. Try again with your new one.|||||The user needs to enter a new password, not one they previously used.
50055|||||The password is expired.|||||The user's password is expired, and therefore their login or session was ended. They will be offered the opportunity to reset it, or may ask an admin to reset it via https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-reset-password-azure-portal
50056|||||Invalid or missing password: password does not exist in the directory for this user.|||||The user should be asked to enter their password again.

50058|||||Session information is not sufficient for single-sign-on.|||||This means that a user is not signed in. This is a common error that's expected when a user is unauthenticated and has not yet signed in. If this error is encountered in an SSO context where the user has previously signed in, this means that the SSO session was either not found or invalid. This error may be returned to the application if prompt=none is specified.

50079|||||Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must enroll in multi-factor authentication to access '{identifier}'.|||||Either a managed user needs to register security info to complete multi-factor authentication, or a federated user needs to get the multi-factor claim from the federated identity provider.

50096|||||Source configured on the audience for the SAML NameID is not compatible with the requested format.|||||No Remediation Provided
50097|||||Device authentication is required.|||||This is not an error - this is an interrupt that triggers device authentication when required due to a Conditional Access policy or because the application or resource requested the device ID in a token. This code alone does not indicate a failure on your users part to sign in. The sign in logs may indicate that the device authentication challenge was passed succesfully or failed.
